Legend/Footnotes
"1. Net expenses of NPISHs, defined as their gross operating expenses less primary sales to households."
"2. Gross output is net of unrelated sales, secondary sales, and sales to business, to government, and to the rest of the world; excludes own-account investment (construction and software)."
"3. Excludes unrelated sales, secondary sales, and sales to business, to government, and to the rest of the world; includes membership dues and fees."
"4. Food consists of food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption; food services, which include purchased meals and beverages, are not classified as food."
5. Consists of gasoline and other energy goods and of electricity and gas services.
"6. Market-based PCE is a supplemental measure that is based on household expenditures for which there are observable price measures.It excludes most imputed transactions (for example, financial services furnished without payment) and the final consumption expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households."
"Note. Chained (2017) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2017 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The residual line is the difference between the first line and the sum of the most detailed lines."
